Haiku 1/366
First day of the year:
Search for seven syllables.
I have just begun.
Haiku 2/366
It looked cold outside.
We should have gone for a walk
Because it was warm.
Haiku 3/366
An aching cold day
False promise from bright sunlight
She leaves in two days
Haiku 4/366
Trade my shirt for hers
To remember each other
While she is away.
Haiku 5/366
A separation.
Her adventure starts today.
He is left behind.
Haiku 6/366
In the mirror�s gaze
I saw the soul of the world
And I need a shave.
Haiku 7/366
The waves are crashing
Beyond this row of houses
It must be high tide
Haiku 8/366
The ocean felt good
Wading after a long run
Too cold to dive in
Haiku 9/366
In bed by midnight
But I could not stay asleep
Without her with me.
Haiku 10/366
What have I not done?
I have not walked on the beach.
I must get outside.
Haiku 11/366
We could use the rain
The sun will not be defeated
It fights to be seen.
Haiku 12/366
It�s hot where she is
Heat like the Serengeti
I think she�s smiling.
Haiku 13/366
Awake in the dark
I have not been sleeping well
Just a few more days
Haiku 14/366
People dig the beard
I don�t quite understand it
But I�ll go along.
Haiku 15/366
Morning betrayed me
By arriving unbidden
As it felt it must
Haiku 16/366
Challenge for the week
Avoid a common letter
Between R and T
Haiku 17/366
Had it been that long?
One week, then two, without her?
One more day to go
Haiku 18/366
A plane overhead
It could be her, returning.
I can only hope.
Haiku 19/366
A late-night email:
The plane brought her back to me.
Reunion tonight!
Haiku 20/366
Jet-lagged and weary
But laying in her own bed
While I read to her
Haiku 21/366
We can lay in bed
All afternoon, into night
Each moment complete
Haiku 22/366
Don't eat the bay leaf
I added it for flavor
Proceed with caution
Haiku 23/366
You say, �Waves look good.�
I say, �It's too cold to surf.�
Seems we are both right. 
Haiku 24/366
Innards extruded.
Another day of this shit
Will leave me hollow
Haiku 25/366
My body aching
Innumerable punches
Thrown from the inside
Haiku 26/366
Ignore the symptoms
I am feeling much better
My laundry smells great.
Haiku 27/366
Lots of paperwork
To fix my wayward insides
I just want to sleep
Haiku 28/366
It's January
The sun is too generous
I'm feeling better.
Haiku 29/366
Sixty degrees out
Normal for this time of year
But we think it's cold.
Haiku 30/366
Where have my eyes gone?
A leopard pattern has them.
Happy distraction.
Haiku 31/366
The berries went bad
I did not eat them in time.
Mold enjoys a treat.
Haiku 32/366
First month is over
Next page in the calendar
Fill the empty days.
Haiku 33/366
I wore shorts today
Pretty nice for Groundhog Day
More of the same, please.
Haiku 34/366
When you are manic
Sleeplessness is the first sign
I could use a nap.
Haiku 35/366
Could this be the end?
Someone might buy the shack
My lifestyle, sold.
Haiku 36/366
The forecast was wrong
The morning broke silent and dry
I let her sleep in.
Haiku 37/366
A humorless day
With skies of unchanging gray
Give me my measure.
Haiku 38/366
Have I lost my touch?
I used to take dictation.
Now I search for words.
Haiku 39/366
Taco Boy today
The menu was new to me
Off-season is best. 
Haiku 40/366
A fitful slumber,
Loaded with disturbing dreams.
I made a mistake. 
Haiku 41/366
Rooted, strong in sand,
Unbowed by storms, undaunted.
My favorite tree. 
Haiku 42/366
Watching the wind trace
Arcs in the marshland water.
Zephyr at high tide.
Haiku 43/366
Love is the prologue,
The antecedent of hate.
Is the reverse true?
Haiku 44/366
Trapped by the cold.
I'd be warmer if I ran.
Instead I shiver.
Haiku 45/366
My feet must touch sand.
Walk until my shoulders drop.
A meditation.
Haiku 46/366
She's sad this morning.
She can't or won't tell me why.
I am affected.
Haiku 47/366
Tsunami of clouds
But promised rain did not fall.
My car needs a wash.
Haiku 48/366
I walk up the beach
Then turn my back to the wind
So I can feel warmth.
Haiku 49/366
Pick up the tempo
I want to swing her faster.
This is our own dance.
Haiku 50/366
I sit with my words,
She is swirling around me.
I hate editing.
Haiku 51/366
An experiment:
Post on Facebook about food,
Let's see who likes it.
Haiku 52/366
I stumbled upon
An internet backwater
Where hate is breeding.
Haiku 53/366
Green leaves are budding
My roses will soon return
The thorns never left.
Haiku 54/366
I saw her again.
Does she know that I am real?
Then again, do I?
Haiku 55/366
Come the winds that howl
Branches twisting violently
That shit woke me up.
Haiku 56/366
The sunrise was shy
Hiding behind purple clouds.
It didn't fool me.
Haiku 57/366
She was fighting me
When I tried an ocho walk.
Next time she should lead.
Haiku 58/366
I don't want to leave
Her arms are comfortable.
I yield, inertia.
Haiku 59/366
The list is daunting
There is so much to be done
Gotta start somewhere.
Haiku 60/366
Welcome to Leap Day
Extra day to change the world
And I wasted it.
Haiku 61/366
It's a rainy day
Cold, windy damp can't defeat
A bubbling-hot lunch.
Haiku 62/366
Fog blows down the street.
Why won't the sun melt these clouds?
It should feel warmer.
Haiku 63/366
Copied my haikus
Into electronic form.
A pain in the ass.
Haiku 64/366
As part of the dance
I pull you off your axis.
Am I strong enough?
Haiku 65/366
My phone is angry
Because I did not charge it.
It beeps its revenge.
Haiku 66/366
A cold, wind-swept beach
Has its own rugged beauty
But too few hot chicks.
Haiku 67/366
I pulled down the vines
That were choking the fig tree.
How will it thank me?
Haiku 68/366
Her blue eyes grew moist
When she read how I missed her.
How did she not know?
Haiku 69/366
I need to get back
To daily meditation
Quell the restless mind.
Haiku 70/366
Time is running out
To write my daily haiku.
Quick! Think of something!
Haiku 71/366
I woke up early
But the sun did not realize
We had changed the clocks.
Haiku 72/366
We messed with the clocks
So they screwed up my rhythm
And left me sleepy.
Haiku 73/366
I have been waiting
For the sun to warm my skin
Like an anole.
Haiku 74/366
And so it begins.
Hordes converge on Folly to
Park in my driveway.
Haiku 75/366
I slept on the porch
While crickets sang their songs to
The crashing waves' tune.
Haiku 76/366
Geese honk angrily
And waddle across the lawn.
So watch your step.
Haiku 77/366
Spin and spin with me.
I will raise up my right arm
You can twirl away.
Haiku 78/366
People are quiet
As morning slowly rises
The geese, not so much.
Haiku 79/366
Three days of dancing,
Soreness when I walk today
My legs protesting.
Haiku 80/366
Sparks spat angrily,
Rage and fury without heat.
I need a new stove.
Haiku 81/366
It had to rain soon:
I could smell it on the wind.
Forecast verified.
Haiku 82/366
Figs are ripening
Two days after equinox.
Has the world been changed?
Haiku 83/366
My guitar waits
It wants me to write a song.
I'm afraid to try.
Haiku 84/366
We sat on bar stools
Watching dogs drink rain water.
Who got adopted?
Haiku 85/366
Caught in the downpour
We ran, soaking, to my house
Chased by a trash can.
Haiku 86/366
Watching cars go by
Where is the man with the stove?
A day spent waiting.
Haiku 87/366
Random sentences
Thoughts from the minds of strangers
From which I will build.
Haiku 88/366
March wind is blowing
But the sun tastes like summer.
Languid days ahead.
Haiku 89/366
Unexpected loss
But the world keeps on turning.
What else can it do?
Haiku 90/366
Relocated Clyde.
Another sign of summer:
I smell like sun block.
Haiku 91/366
Snowy egrets meet
There are important matters
They need to discuss.
Haiku 92/366
Alone on the dock
Guarding the crab trap for us.
What a lucky duck!
Haiku 93/366
First swim of the year
Salt water lifts my body.
I am not buoyant.
Haiku 94/366
Pruning the rose bush
It attacked me with its thorns
To prevent my help.
Haiku 95/366
They're easy to spot
They're the ones who don't realize
The tide comes back in.
Haiku 96/366
I picked up my pen
Sat with my open notebook
No words would come out
Haiku 97/366
A chill intruded
My sunny disposition
Time for her warm smile.
Haiku 98/366
What a dull party
One hundred mindless talkers
Zombies on the march.
Haiku 99/366
I made myself laugh
Which in turn made her laugh too
So much the better!
Haiku 100/366
On a six-mile run
That last mile, into the wind
Forges stamina.
Haiku 101/366
One hundred days down
The time is harder to find
And so are the words.
Haiku 102/366
The day has crept by
Only an hour remains.
I will sleep through it.
Haiku 103/366
I hold a belief
That I won't be cold again
Starting tomorrow.
Haiku 104/366
It's superstition
Triscadecaphobia
I am not afraid.
Haiku 105/366
In contra dancing
The woman is always right.
What does that make me?
Haiku 106/366
Bug Stomp is over
The stiffness has just begun
Feet sing protest songs.
Haiku 107/366
Mice steal the roach traps.
That problem will solve itself
Since they are poison.
Haiku 108/366
Sitting on my porch
Breezes stir the fig tree leaves
I'll write a poem.
Haiku 109/366
The oak under siege
I run over tidal pools
To lend it my strength.
Haiku 110/366
My errands are done
But I forgot to get things.
I should make a list.
Haiku 111/366
Friday afternoon
A weekend of dance ahead
Get myself ready.
Haiku 112/366
We can be silly
When we've had too much to drink.
Here's to you, my dear.
Haiku 113/366
A day of drizzle
And mechanical objects
Dormant magic spells
Haiku 114/366
If not for the wind
The weather would be perfect
No one's on the beach.
Haiku 115/366
I awoke groggy
Already behind schedule
Too long of a nap.
Haiku 116/366
The wind blows fiercely
Pouring down the beach with rage.
I run into it.
Haiku 117/366
That's not rain I feel.
It is the wind at my back
Blowing off my sweat.
Haiku 118/366
It's after midnight.
I will have to bend the rules.
I'm adaptable.
Haiku 119/366
Sometimes there's an itch
Wriggling tingle in the nose
Is it allergies?
Haiku 120/366
I went for a swim.
I found it so much harder
To breath on my left.
Haiku 121/366
My hair is dripping
But this isn't sweet water
I need a shower.
Haiku 122/366
The day escaped me.
I did not make time for her
Except in my thoughts.
Haiku 123/366
Fonts, sizes, margins!
There's so much to consider.
I just want to write.
Haiku 124/366
My head is swimming
In ether between my eyes.
Someone pull me out.
Haiku 125/366
My eyes are heavy
I feel the weight of the day.
Sick boy, get some rest!
Haiku 126/366
The darkness has me.
Bat wings whisper in my ears,
Talons in my hair.
Haiku 127/366
She's making dinner
Because she cares about me.
I feel undeserving.
Haiku 128/366
If wishes had wings
Mine would fly to the rafters
To stay out of reach.
Haiku 129/366
Minutes counting down.
I'll be onstage in two hours
Napping is futile.
Haiku 130/366
We needed this rain.
The roses leap to catch drops
Longing to be wet.
Haiku 131/366
Taking three days off
No email and no Facebook
Just music and her.
Haiku 132/366
Do you need paper?
Can you trust your memory?
I don't trust mine now.
Haiku 133/366
Soon after midnight
My pen become a drumstick
And died for the beat.
Haiku 134/366
It can drizzle now
Just stop before we head out
No one likes wet LEAF.
Haiku 135/366
Shouting all around
Fun at the tops of their lungs.
People are so weird.
Haiku 136/366
The car is unlocked
And the windows left open
Did it rain last night?
Haiku 137/366
First run in a while
I felt bad the whole time
Not in the good way.
Haiku 138/366
It boggles the mind
Why would someone steal sandals?
My feet were in them.
Haiku 139/366
The sky is clearing
Swaths of blue sky expanding
Amid stubborn clouds.
Haiku 140/366
The dishes are done
And we had a nice long nap
A petty good day.
Haiku 141/366
Tennis anyone?
The wind kept taking my lobs
Plus I kinda suck.
Haiku 142/366
Dishwasher warm glass
Where gin and tonic meet ice
To chill the spirit.
Haiku 143/366
His bladder is full
He can't hold it anymore
Any house will do.
Haiku 144/366
That price can't be right
I asked him to double-check
It worked out for me.
Haiku 145/366
I tried and I tried
The current was strong today
Swimming was futile.
Haiku 146/366
Tango Girls en route
But I am ready for them:
I finished cleaning.
Haiku 147/366
Don't be so nervous
Nothing bad will happen here
As far as you know.
Haiku 148/366
My strength is failing
I can't find the will to fight
Sleep, please bolster me!
Haiku 149/366
For souls to be bared
We need to communicate.
So listen up, punk.
Haiku 150/366
I rocked it last night
But where was everybody?
They missed a great show.
Haiku 151/366
Hot sun on bare skin
Feet freshly crusted with sand
First signs of heat stroke.
Haiku 152/366
Another notebook
New pages waiting for words
I shan't disappoint.
Haiku 153/366
I write every day
Some people say that's a lot
What else can I do?
Haiku 154/366
A pleasant surprise.
When she answered the door
She's not wearing pants.
Haiku 155/366
Perfect cloudless sky
Every day should be like this
Unless I'm at work.
Haiku 156/366
I wait patiently
The charcoal does not get hot.
These steaks are ruined.
Haiku 157/366
An hour of rainfall
Left me the beach to myself
Rain is now my friend.
Haiku 158/366
Internet is down
Which would make for a fun day
If not for the rain.
Haiku 159/366
A gorgeous evening
Spent with someone I adore
Now I'll make dinner.
Haiku 160/366
This seat is solid
Thirty minutes and I'm sore
I could use more ass.
Haiku 161/366
It's cooler outside
Sitting on a shady porch
Air, unconditioned.
Haiku 162/366
I couldn't hear it
The clamor of death throes
Tough luck, litte crabs.
Haiku 163/366
O sudden downpour!
How swiftly you cleanse the world.
But your timing stinks.
Haiku 164/366
The sky is clearing
The wind at last dying down
I enjoy my porch.
Haiku 165/366
Rumbling all around
Lightning streaking in the west
This storm is a tease.
Haiku 166/366
I love weekend trips
New places, new adventures
Someone pack for me.
Haiku 167/366
We're in a dorm room
Cinder blocks walls and small beds
Reminds me of then.
Haiku 168/366
There's so much to do
So I'm scanning the schedule
For a time to nap
Haiku 169/366
A busy weekend
My body cries out for rest
So why can't I sleep?
Haiku 170/366
In next week's forecast
Triple-digit temperatures
That's so fucking hot!
Haiku 171/366
Foul, blood-sucking things
Heed citronella's warning
Don't make me slap you.
Haiku 172/366
I come here a lot
They should have already poured
My gin and tonic.
Haiku 173/366
Rain 4.5 miles
I fought for every last one
My lungs will thank me.
Haiku 174/366
A famine ended
Cries of the starving silenced
It's a good burger.
Haiku 175/366
Tuberculosis
Good enough for Oscar Wilde
Good enough for me.
Haiku 176/366
Try not to panic
When breath runs out. The water's
only 3 feet deep.
Haiku 177/366
The mower, it roars.
Long dormant, it awakens
But the gas is stale.
Haiku 178/366
Let me tell you this:
Mustache and runny nose?
Not a good combo.
Haiku 179/366
I swear I'm not vain
But sitting on my wallet
Makes my butt lumpy.
Haiku 180/366
The birds wrestle figs
As sunrise walks down the street
This quiet won't last.
Haiku 181/366
Ink stains on linen
Stubborn against my efforts
Might I add: dammit!
Haiku 182/366
Oh no! I forgot!
Somehow I let a day pass
Without a haiku
Haiku 183/366
Halfway through the year
One hundred eighty-three days
That's a lot of words.
Haiku 184/366
For dinner tonight
Pasta with sausage and figs
High levels of yum!
Haiku 185/366
Where does each day go?
Those hours pass by too quickly
Or my watch is fast.
Haiku 186/366
People wield the flag
Like a holy talisman
Blessing all their sins.
Haiku 187/366
I missed the riot
And the hours-long traffic jam
Glad I wasn't home.
Haiku 188/366
They would take it all
Every last drop of my blood.
God damn mosquitoes.
Haiku 189/366
Something to ponder:
What's the maximum age for
Being rambunctious?
Haiku 190/366
I watch in wonder
Cities float down the Cooper.
Those are some big ships.
Haiku 191/366
Dead bugs everywhere
I don't know where they came from
But hey, they're dead so....
Haiku 192/366
I can smell the rain
The scent of the storm that looms
Beach-goers beware!
Haiku 193/366
In the Atlantic
Rogue waves tried to steal my pants
Imagine the cheek!
Haiku 194/366
I have my notebook
And a cold bottle of beer
I'm ready to write.
Haiku 195/366
My concentration
Broken into small pieces
Duct tape won't fix that.
Haiku 196/366
Flotsam or jetsam
What is the difference, really?
I'm one of the two.
Haiku 197/366
She should be here now
Sitting with me in the sand
Her hand held in mine.
Haiku 198/366
I got there early
And took a seat at the bar
Waiting for the show.
Haiku 199/366
I dreamed of water
A warm green wave charging me
Sweep me off my feet.
Haiku 200/366
With a machete
Hacking my way though dense growth
Someone mow my lawn!
Haiku 201/366
Sirocco blowing
Hot dry wind to steal my breath
Makes running less fun.
Haiku 202/366
Energy is finite
I can't engage in this fight
Your post is stupid.
Haiku 203/366
I want to join her
Out in the deeper water
My fear holds me back.
Haiku 204/366
We'll struggle for hours
Toil and strain against the door
So-called simple task.
Haiku 205/366
A familiar stench
My nose wrinkles, unbidden
I'm not wearing socks.
Haiku 206/366
Like flashbulbs, strobe lights,
Lightning rends the western sky
God must be angry.
Haiku 207/366
Traffic is not moving
I'll never get these hours back
Kill time with road rage.
Haiku 208/366
O, great tangled web
Spun in the worst of places.
Lucy hates spiders.
Haiku 209/366
Crucible of steam
Labor of heat and pressure
I hate ironing
Haiku 210/366
Everyone's orange
Not like Jersey Shore orange
More tinged by sunset.
Haiku 211/366
Streets like tangled yarn
Labrythine roads, all the same
Save me, GPS!
Haiku 212/366
Electrical storm
Your skin can sense the ions
If you admit it.
Haiku 213/366
It's a pleasant sound
Rain falling on broad figs leaves
As long as I'm dry.
Haiku 214/366
Explosions outside
The whole house quaking with fear
Must be terrorists.
Haiku 215/366
Electricity
My skin burning from your touch
Stupid jellyfish.
Haiku 216/366
I adore you, but
Stop messing with your toenail
It's freaking me out.
Haiku 217/366
What weird light is this
Reflecting off the water
Opposite the sun.
Haiku 218/366
I can dance tango
But I prefer milonga
I don't have to think.
Haiku 219/366
I suffer a plague
A thick cloud of mosquitoes
I can't swat them all.
Haiku 220/366
Let go of these things
Watch them float away from you
Feel your hand relax
Haiku 221/366
It rained all morning
So the ocean was all mine
Well, and the dolphins.
Haiku 222/366
It's hard to believe
Someone would poach our crabs
That is so uncool.
Haiku 223/366
In the waiting room
A raucous dirge on TV
Fills my head with noise.
Haiku 224/366
Trampled underfoot
Technology defeats me
Progress marches on.
Haiku 225/366
A warmed-up cookie
On top of softened ice cream
Two good ideas, joined.
Haiku 226/366
I rarely spend time
Thinking about the future
Why should I start now?
Haiku 227/366
Money talks, it's true
But it has other talents
Like hiding from me.
Haiku 228/366
My hopes and dreams dashed
A day's waiting ended in tears
I'm out of charcoal.
Haiku 229/366
Summoned to the beach
By a sunrise deep and red
To hear a lecture.
Haiku 230/366
Her scream woke me up
Or else I might not have known
A roach was on me.
Haiku 231/366
Ignored by the dogs
As we walked along the beach
They prefer Lucy.
Haiku 232/366
On an idle day
As long as we're together
No time is wasted.
Haiku 233/366
I think I deserve
To call myself a poet
My stuff doesn't rhyme.
Haiku 234/366
For a few brief hours
I have staved off entropy
With a lawn mower
Haiku 235/366
I am frustrated
That I can't fix her problems
Let alone my own.
Haiku 236/366
I sat pondering
The weight of an attogram
I must have been drunk.
Haiku 237/366
The sun has returned
I don't ask it where it's been
I'm just glad it's back.
Haiku 238/366
In our writing group
Folks raved about my poems.
How do I fix them?
Haiku 239/366
Dear Fellow Drivers,
Please learn to use turn signals
Thanks in advance, me.
Haiku 240/366
Dear Palmetto Bugs,
I poisoned you days ago
Just die already.
Haiku 241/366
To my moldy bread:
Your green spots disappoint me.
Now I have no lunch.
Haiku 242/366
Dear Power Washers
Please turn off that compressor
Six hours is enough.
Haiku 243/366
Dear Fluttering bats:
Some people are scared of you
But I think you're cool. 
Haiku 244/366
Dear Butterfly Swarm:
Please enjoy the lantana.
With affection, Me.
Haiku 245/366
Dearest Birthday Girl,
All the compliments you've earned
Won't fit in this space.
Haiku 246/366
Dear Network Settings,
This is not the time to fail.
Now get back to work!
Haiku 247/366
The red shirt should not
Get dried with the other clothes
It can't stand the heat.
Haiku 248/366
First night of improv
Why am I so darn nervous?
Stage fright is a bitch.
Haiku 249/366
A wave rolled for days
Crossing thousands of miles to
Break my boogie board.
Haiku 250/366
In my last blog post
I spoke about moving on
Prophetic headline
Haiku 251/366
Back in the mountains
Makes me miss running uphill
Just a little bit.
Haiku 252/366
You take half measures
Tunes played in three-quarter time
Music is tricky.
Haiku 253/366
The frame barely square
Moving through gelatin ooze.
My legs are tired.
Haiku 254/366
The search continues
To find a place to house me
It has just begun.
Haiku 255/366
My quest is simple
To find a place near water
Where I can fuck up.
Haiku 256/366
I'm not angry yet
But I'm moving through stages
Grieving Folly Beach
Haiku 257/366
A truck knocked her down
And she bounced back up unharmed
She's unbreakable.
Haiku 258/366
One thing I have learned
If she is not beside me
I can't take a nap.
Haiku 259/366
A birthday completes
A lap around the sun, like
A molinete.
Haiku 260/366
Ulan-batoor is
Mongolia's capitol
Why do I know that?
Haiku 261/366
I don't understand
If they want me to rent, why
Don't they call me back?
Haiku 262/366
It's hard to explain
This is where I have to be
In spite of the costs.
Haiku 263/366
It's all we can do
To keep our feet in motion
When those we love fall.
Haiku 264/366
I did my homework.
Critiquing is an art form.
I should sign my name.
Haiku 265/366
Hope can be crafty
Shining through cracks in darkness
Unless it's a trap.
Haiku 266/366
I keep it simple.
High heat and a little salt
Man I love scallops.
Haiku 267/366
In the evening light
Fish leaping from the water.
What is chasing them?
Haiku 268/366
Black mold in the walls
Dry rot on the windowsill
So close to perfect.
Haiku 269/366
I walked over here
Hoping for a miracle
Which did not occur.
Haiku 270/366
I fell dead asleep
Before I wrote my haiku
Sorry about that.
Haiku 271/366
There's so many leads
No time to pursue them all
Days are running out.
Haiku 272/366
Choices narrowing
All my options will soon close.
Don't I get a vote?
Haiku 273/366
Invisible boys
Riding invisible bikes
I almost hit them.
Haiku 274/366
How can this be so?
That a place can break my heart
Setting me adrift.
Haiku 275/366
It makes me nervous
Identity theft is real!
I like who I am.
Haiku 276/366
I got my hopes up
For a place in IOP
It was just a tease.
Haiku 277/366
I write what I feel
Putting these words together
No plagiarizing.
Haiku 278/366
A silent prayer
A Folly Beach miracle
Too bad it's a scam.
Haiku 279/366
Which offends me more?
The scam, or him thinking that
I would fall for it?
Haiku 280/366
Back from the cleaners
All the rumples are flattened
My shirt does not fit.
Haiku 281/366
So hard to see now
No matter how much I strain
My pen's out of ink.
Haiku 282/366
I feel the chill of
Conspiracy in the air
I lack central heat.
Haiku 283/366
The blue of the sea
Stuns me. I cannot believe
That I have to leave.
Haiku 284/366
Emotion creeps up
Threatens to undo me while
I walk on the beach.
Haiku 285/366
My packing frenzy
Almost had a casualty
When I lost my phone.
Haiku 286/366
Boxes and boxes
My whole life wrapped in cardboard
Waiting to be moved.
Haiku 287/366
This is my goodbye
My feet, once more, in sand.
Thank you, Folly Beach!
Haiku 288/366
I cannot get in
The entry blocked by locked doors
None of my keys work.
Haiku 289/366
White clouds blossoming
Graying minute by minute.
Aren't we all though?
Haiku 290/366
Printable vaccines:
What could possibly go wrong?
This is how it starts.
Haiku 291/366
Went shopping today
Nothing like a full kitchen
To make a place home.
Haiku 292/366
Here is a question:
If I go to the State Fair
Am I a redneck?
Haiku 293/366
The leaves are changing
No matter how much we want
Them to stay the same
Haiku 294/366
The sky is glowing.
Could be a hundred campfires,
Could be aliens.
Haiku 295/366
What a perfect day!
Bright sunshine and new music
Too bad it's over.
Haiku 296/366
LEAF is over now
And I had to work today
It's always something.
Haiku 297/366
Ah, the moon! Turning
Her face away, coquettish,
Playing hard to get.
Haiku 298/366
This is a new life
Yet the old one claws at me
Picking at my scabs.
Haiku 299/366
From where I now sit
I cannot hear the ocean
But I can smell it.
Haiku 300/366
Something impending
Ominous skies, noisy wind
Where's my umbrella?
Haiku 301/366
Fifty years ago
Humanity almost died
Before I was born.
Haiku 302/366
Are you feeling that?
That's the feeling of summer
Abandoning us.
Haiku 303/366
Those motions pain me
Though once they were familiar
The gym hates me now.
Haiku 304/366
How strange the silence
I expected some fanfare
For my new license.
Haiku 305/366
Poetic License?
Sure, but you're writing haiku.
There are rules, dammit!
Haiku 306/366
While crossing the bridge
The wind tried to lift my shirt
I ran like the flash.
Haiku 307/366
These aren't gray hairs
These laps around the sun leave
Interstellar dust.
Haiku 308/366
A perfect morning
To wake with no agenda
And her beside me.
Haiku 309/366
Visions fill my head
The collages I would make
If I had talent.
Haiku 310/366
It's Monday again
It seems to me that weekends
Need more days in them.
Haiku 311/366
Dismal days like these
Make me want to stay inside
Like an introvert.
Haiku 312/366
It gets dark early
The daylight hours feel compressed
Seasonal Affect.
Haiku 313/366
Did the light just dim?
Or is that my mind playing tricks?
It's not fooling me.
Haiku 314/366
Arbitrary rules
Spending their whole lives waiting
For me to break them.
Haiku 315/366
There's a second world
Reflected in the water.
This one's dryer though.
Haiku 316/366
I tried blues dancing
But failed to master the pop
Kinda got me down.
Haiku 317/366
Could that have been it?
The last warm day of the year?
I spent it inside.
Haiku 318/366
From my apartment
I watched the season change
But I stayed the same
Haiku 319/366
I hear the bell chime
Extolling me to get up
Dinner is ready.
Haiku 320/366
Who is Spider-Man?
A misfit hero always
Hiding from Aunt Mae.
Haiku 321/366
Day three twenty one
Numbers decline in sequence
Counting down to what?
Haiku 322/366
I once had a dream
That the ground swallowed me whole
Must've been hungry.
Haiku 323/366
The hot stove is hot
We know this but we forget
The hot stove is hot.
Haiku 324/366
I must get around
People see me everywhere
Or Dad was busy.
Haiku 325/366
A strange glowing orb
In the sky, burning through clouds
Quick! Call the Air Force!
Haiku 326/366
Before Thanksgiving
Prettiest day in a while
Thankful for that.
Haiku 327/366
The marsh grass shimmers
In angular autumn light.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Haiku 328/366
Cold air is coming
We spent the morning outside
While it was still warm
Haiku 329/366
The air smells like spring
Which is really kinda weird
Since it's November.
Haiku 330/366
One month til Christmas?
The calendar can't be right
I'm in disbelief.
Haiku 331/366
The key to running
8.6 miles is being
Too stubborn to quit.
Haiku 332/366
This isn't working
There's too many things to do
Snatching crumbs of time.
Haiku 333/366
Walking home I saw
Burrows in the drainage ditch
Some kind of varmint?
Haiku 334/366
My poor basil plant
Deprived of the heat you love
Not unlike myself.
Haiku 335/366
That was a close one
Twenty five minutes to spare
For today's haiku.
Haiku 336/366
So it's come to this.
First day of December
Thirty days to go.
Haiku 337/366
As I sat and watched
Sunset a crimson blanket
Pulled over the world.
Haiku 338/366
It's nearing Christmas
Mosquitoes tried to bite me
Talk about a lame gift.
Haiku 339/366
It seems strange to me
You keep having birthdays
Yet you do not age.
Haiku 340/366
The people downstairs
Have red and green Christmas lights
Pointing to my place.
Haiku 341/366
It's a conundrum:
What should I have for dinner?
Decisions are hard.
Haiku 342/366
Something in the air.
I scent I know from before.
Someone's been smoking.
Haiku 343/366
I have white wine chilled.
What dressing should I use if
These are salad days?
Haiku 344/366
It feels like I've been
Hacking away forever
My backhand still sucks.
Haiku 345/366
What could replace it?
How am I supposed to make
Gluten-free cookies?
Haiku 346/366
I had one in mind
But I didn't write it down
Now I've lost it. Poo!
Haiku 347/366
I invite you in
Watch your orange tongue flicker
I've started a fire.
Haiku 348/366
Someone lied to us.
Time isn't money, it's space.
My schedule is full.
Haiku 349/366
I've held my glass up
Said a bunch of silly words
Can we please drink now?
Haiku 350/366
We can't understand
Who can offer an excuse
For murdered children?
Haiku 351/366
Someone planned these paths
But these desire lines tell me
That they got it wrong.
Haiku 352/366
One week till Christmas
And I've gotten nothing done.
Can I turn Jewish?
Haiku 353/366
The light's fading fast
But it's still too bright to take
Off my sunglasses
Haiku 354/366
Christmas trivia
Was not very kind to us.
Bah humbug, indeed.
Haiku 355/366
Squeeze it all into
What little space remains, or
Get a new notebook.
Haiku 356/366
The world didn't end
Now we only need to fear
Folks who thought it would.
Haiku 357/366
I see your fresh wounds
Don't martyr yourself for me:
It's only oysters.
Haiku 358/366
Miscalculation
Instead of 6.2, I
Ran 7.1
Haiku 359/366
Punish my guitar
By banging out all the chords
It had it coming.
Haiku 360/366
Foggy this morning
The Christmas sun was lazy
Or waiting for me.
Haiku 361/366
Thunderstorms today
Then the clouds dissipated
Pushed by winter wind.
Haiku 362/366
Only four days left
Before the end of the year
What will I do then?
Haiku 363/366
It takes much longer
When the weather turns colder
To get myself dressed.
Haiku 364/366
Loading up the car
One thing is perfectly clear:
I pack like a girl.
Haiku 365/366
I have a vision
But I can't do everything
So I'll post an ad.
Haiku 366/366
I guess this is it
The last haiku of the year
Sorry it's so lame.
